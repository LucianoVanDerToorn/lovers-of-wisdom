TODO:

* How to read philosphy, reading strategies
* The fact that philosophers respond to each other (to read 19th century German philosophy you need to understand the major philosophers from the pre-socratics to the 19th century)
* The fact that philosophies are sometimes products of their time, so getting historical context is important as well to get the full understanding; secondary sources give this sometimes,
* Sometimes reading secondary sources first helps you understanding the primary sources
* Philosophy terminology explained
* How to use this reading list

Our approach to learning philosophy is based on three steps:

1. **High level overview of the complete history of philosophy**
    <br/>to be able to properly understand the primary works
2. **Reading the most important primary works**
    <br/>because the philosophers themselves are the best at explaining their ideas
3. **Diving deep into the subjects that attract you most**
    <br/>depending on your preferences you can read and omit works
